    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity measures how the execution time of an algorithm changes with input size. It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is when handling large datasets or computations.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. It is often represented using notations like O(n) to describe how memory usage grows with input size.</p>
